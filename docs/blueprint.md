## Core Features:

- Customizable Tax Rates: Allows users to customize the commission, payment, and anticipation rates, which persist in local storage. Persisting tax rates is done with a tool which compares local storage keys to the labels associated with each rate, and presents the user with options to merge any discrepancies or to report suspicious differences for admin review.
- Real-time Calculation: Calculates the suggested selling price based on the entered net value and commission rate.
- Plan Comparison: Compares profit margins across iFood's Basic and Partner delivery plans.
- Price Suggestion: Dynamically displays a suggestion for a final sales price, to assist in maximizing the user's profit.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated orange (#FF9130) for a vibrant and energetic feel, referencing food culture.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated blue (#0A0C17) to provide strong contrast, and evoke the 'dark mode' aesthetic from the prompt.
- Accent color: Desaturated violet (#8062C6) as an analogous color to complement the orange primary color, while setting off button states and highlights.
- Font: 'Montserrat' sans-serif for both headers and body text, giving a modern and professional look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- The layout follows a minimalist style, focusing on a central calculation card.
